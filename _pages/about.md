Hello, I'm a CS PhD student studying in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I'm under [Dmitrii Ustiugov](https://ustiugov.github.io/) 's supervision.

Prior to this, I obtain my bachelor degree in Shanghai JiaoTong University ([SJTU](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)).

My research interests lies in distributed system, cloud computing and system for AI. I'm currently doing LLM serving acceleration.
